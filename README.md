# MindSelfness
Optimizing Product Growth and Retention via User Data Analysis


### **1. Project Overview**

- **1.1. Business Context & Analytical Objective:**
    
    > "MindSelfness, a rapidly growing SaaS mobile application, requires a clear understanding of its user journey to ensure continuous growth. While the app effectively attracts new users, there's a need for deeper insights into how users engage with the product, how long they stay active, and how effectively free users convert to premium subscribers. Without a comprehensive view of user behavior, it becomes challenging for our product, marketing, and leadership teams to identify key growth opportunities, understand why users might leave, and refine strategies for long-term success.
    > 
    > 
    > **Analytical Objective:** This analysis aims to provide a unified, data-driven understanding of user behavior. Our goal is to deliver essential insights and practical recommendations that will enable MindSelfness to improve user acquisition, boost engagement, enhance retention, and ultimately maximize product monetization."
    > 
- **1.2. Target Audience:**
    
    > "This analytical report and its accompanying interactive dashboard are designed for key stakeholders across MindSelfness, enabling data-driven decision-making for:
    > 
    > - **Marketing Team:** To evaluate the performance of acquisition channels, understand user registration trends, and optimize campaign effectiveness.

- **1.3. North Star Metrics:**
